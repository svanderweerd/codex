[Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep) is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by
altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all
voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,and reduced interactions with surroundings. Distinguished
from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli.
