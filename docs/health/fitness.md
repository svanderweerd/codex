This is page is meant to document my thoughts on fitness and how to optimise your work outs alongside a full time job and other activities that you want to pursue.

# Schemas

I currently do full body workouts, split between two different schemas. Each schema has two major exercises: the *low bar squat* and the *deadlift*. Each workout also has pull-ups with the purpose of breaking through the plateau of 25 reps in total.

# Tips & Tricks

## Squats

Squats seem straightforward, but are actually one of the most technical exercises that you can do. To maintain a good technique and optimise for gaining weights, I have created a list op tips and tricks below. These tricks assume a low bar position.

* Don't use a pad to soften the bar on your back! This impairs your technique and causes you to lift less weight (the pad absorbs part of the weight)
* Do shoulder rotation exercises before you start. The low bar position might make your shoulder uncomfortable.
* When your shoulder starts getting too uncomfortable you might naturally bend your wrist to compensate. To counteract that, use a thumbless grip (thumbs over the bar). This allows you to maintain a straight wrist position and lock the bar.
* Don't move your elbows back and forth. This moves the bar and fucks up your technique. To lock your elbows, act like you are bending the barbell towards ths sides of your chest.
* Move downwards in a smooth way. Don't go slow, use the momentum in your muscles at the bottom, to go up again. Think of 'bouncing' at the bottom. Use that momentum. Going too slow will impair your technique.
* When you are at the bottom, move your ass up first. Think of a cord that is attached to your ass. This will train the hamstring and glutes better!
