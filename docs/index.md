# Introduction

This is my [digital garden](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/digital_garden/). This is where I write. Keep track of my thoughts, be it lingering or active ones. Write down ideas, concepts and topics that interest me or that I might need in the future. In the past I've tried to take notes in a notebook, on my ipad, but also using third party applications such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [Notion](https://notion.so). Alas, as time passes, I find myself incapable of actively maintaining either one of them, or extract meaningful and longterm value from them. The personal notebook or Ipad notes become cluttered and unorganized, losing my motivation to use it as a personal library. Similar feelings arose when using Notion.so. Building comprehensive tables, code snippets, and referring to other pages often became a mess as well. I found that Obisidan grew on me - I even purschased a yearly subscription to support the developers. It has a steep learning curve, but eventually I got the hang of it. Unfortunately, this become somewhat difficult for me to maintain as well: it is self hosted on my laptop, which I don't all the time. Instead, I often work from devices that are provided by my clients, making it difficult to actively work in Obsidian. Additionally, I can't seem to use Obsidian for light-hearted topics such as fitness, or use it to put in my fleeting notes. I can't shake the feeling that I need to use Obsidian for academic grade documentation only, or use it to document advanced topics. This ultimately led me back to old school note taking, scattering my thoughts all over the place (Notion, Obsidian, physical notebooks, and Apple Notes).

With digital garden, I embark on my next journey of collecting and maintaining my thoughts; a backup of my brains, so to speak. As [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#target-audience) put it:

> The goal of these pages is not to be a model of concision, maximizing entertainment value per word, or to preach to a choir by elegantly repeating a conclusion. Rather, I am attempting to explain things to my future self, who is intelligent and interested, but has forgotten. What I am doing is explaining why I decided what I did to myself and noting down everything I found interesting about it for future reference. I hope my other readers, whomever they may be, might find the topic as interesting as I found it, and the essay useful or at least entertainingâ€“but the intended audience is my future self.

## Principles

Based on Gwern's [long site principle](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-site). Heavily inspired by [Lyz Digital
Garden](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/).
