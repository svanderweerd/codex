# Layout

I am actively using Python for several use case:

* transform and load complex Excel files.
* web scrawling (e.g., Funda scraper).
* web application for IT Risk Management (based on FastAPI).

My Python docs will focus on concepts that I have encountered throughout the development of my use cases, in
contrast to covering topics that I have learned throughout several courses (e.g., bootcamp courses on Udemy). The
reasoning behind this, is that focus on topics that I encountered will resonate better with me; after all, I have
used or needed them when building stuff.

# Developer roadmap

There is a good Python developer roadmap
on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/z3gntf/detailed_python_developer_roadmap/) if you are new to
Python (it can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/amaargiru/pyroad) as well).

The roadmap covers the following concepts:

* Data structures
* Data management
* Data flows
* OOP
* Language skeleton
* Multithreading & Multiprocessing
* Common practices
* Algorithms
* Databases
* Web
* Architecture
