Nice [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/n0kukj/is_domain_driven_design_still_the_recommended/) post
discussing domain driven design.

Another interesting post is provided
by [microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/)
where they talk about ddd and Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).
